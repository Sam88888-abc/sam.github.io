Firefly
</abbr>
Firefly is the character on the game named Honkai-Star Rail.Firefly is a gentle soul—quiet, but deeply sincere. Though she's not someone who easily navigates social circles, her kindness isn't expressed through words, but through actions that speak volumes. She's the kind of person whose care you can feel without needing to hear it. In moments when I felt lost, she was there—not with grand gestures or loud reassurances, but with quiet presence, heartfelt concern, and unwavering support. Her warmth is subtle, but real, and it stays with you long after the moment has passed.
