<font face=Arial size=5 color=black>A <font face=Arial size=6 color=black><i><b>shepherd</i></b> <font face=Arial size=5 color=black>boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<font face=Arial size=5 color=black>One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted,"Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying away the lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but didn't find any wolf.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<font face=Arial size=5 color=black>The boy laughed and repiled,"It was just fun. There is no wolf here".<b><i><font face=Arial size=6 color=black> The boy played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</b></i>
</p>
<br> 
<p> 
<font face=Arial size=5 color=black>After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep, suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs, The boy was frightened and cried loudly,"Wolf! Wolf! <del>The wolf is carrying a lamb away!"</del>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<font face=Arial size=6 color=purple>The farmers <font face=Arial size=4 color=purple><sup>thought</sup> <font face=Arial size=6 color=purple>the boy was playing <font face=Arial size=4 color=purple><sub>mischief</sub> <font face=Arial size=6 color=purple>again. <font face=Arial size=5 color=black>So, no one paid attention to him and didn't come to his help.
